    "transcript": "Today is February 13th in the year 2009 We are here at the Office of Davis and Matthews located at one Ashburn Street Danbury Connecticut for the continued deposition of Jacob Hall taken on behalf of the defendant in the matter of Jacob Hall versus Martha Morgan pending in the Connecticut Superior Court JD of Danbury at Danbury docket number CV 070673451 si am Robert Swipe Notary Public and certified legal video specialist on behalf of the legal evidence division of inside look TV of Danbury Connecticut I hereby affirm that I will record this deposition in a fair and impartial manner The time is 1117 ami would now ask that counsel please identify themselves for the record I'm Stephanie Carroll and I represent the defendant in this matter for the record My name is Bob Mason from the law firm of Gil Pierce and Mason representing the opponent Jacob Hall We are going to do the usual stipulations except we won't waive reading and signing And at the outside I would like to note that the deposition was originally scheduled for 930 It is now 1118 I just want to make it clear that the opponent has I mean he's out of state resident has come here at a considerable inconvenience and expense at his part for a third day of his deposition And I just want to make it clear and notwithstanding the late start date we will not volitionally produce Mr Hall for another day of deposition if we do not complete today is that understood And the record should reflect that the reno of videotape deposition was for 10 a.m. this morning and I apologize for the delay in the start We are going to continue with our deposition today and I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath Do you understand that Yes I do Mr Hall You have been ordered to produce certain documents for this deposition and there was a court order that you produce all Hall Corporation receipts and disbursements in your possession And did you do that I believe I complied There was one box of materials and so I take it that Hall Corporation is not in possession or control of any receipts or any other proof of disbursements Stephanie we produced the ledgers of all generating all receipts and disbursements of Hall Corporation Perhaps there is a nomenclature I don't believe we were ordered nor did anyone contemplate that we would actually produce you know each slip of every piece of business But there are for the years through 2007 The general ledgers of Hall Corporation reflect all the receipts and disbursements of whole corporation I'm just trying to establish that he has fully complied with the subpoena and the order of the court I just want to make it clear that there is a problem with description in his mind we produced all the Hall Corporation receipts and disbursement ledgers and you were also Mr Hall ordered to produce the front and back of any and all checks documents and statements held under the bank and or financial accounts of Hall Corporation And did you comply with that request I believe so Yes I am concerned only because in my packet I had General Ledgers for 2002 and 2003 And I am not so sure that the corresponding checks were completely disclosed although they were micro fish or small checks but that's the way I get them just so you know they don't they don't send them any other Let me ask a question in 2004 Were you banking with Citibank solely in 2004 No solely No I cl credit union also Ok Well I'll get through that but as far as you're concerned you've given us all the checks Yes I have and those front and back of all checks documents and statements in your possession showing a transfer of funds from Jacob Hall and and Jacob and Hall Corporation to the Jacob Hall Trust and are those documents disclosed to the best of my knowledge They are And did we receive a copy of all American Express and or any other credit card billing and or financial statements held under the account Hall Corporation Yes you have And so as I have seen this there is a there are documents for Hall Corporation which is an American Express account That's correct And was it in the name of that company I think Excalibur or something And those are accounts the only accounts the only credit cards that Hall Corporation possessed Uh No I think a few years ago I had an American Express blue and then I went to a a different kind So as far as you're concerned what is disclosed here is complete with respect to charge accounts for Hall Corporation And I think the indication was everything he could locate That's correct Is there any other account owned or used by Hall Corporation with any other credit card company Not that I'm aware of So you have two Hall Corporation credit cards one through American Express one account through mastercard No no I don't think I I don't I didn't say that Uh traditionally I would I would use only one card but that doesn't mean I have other cards outstanding It's just I I would just use one and then I went to a different kind A gold business Yeah Yeah gold business But you have never had more than one American Express account at any one time under Hall Corporation No Did you ever have such an account for which you have no documentation No documentation No no I never had such an account So you never had any other Mastercard or Visas other than the Excalibur That's correct And the Hall Limited Partnership I believe had an American Express card Yes they did But that was it That's it And also the order was that you provide your tax returns from 2000 to 2003 And I believe you provided the schedules that are part and parcel of your individual tax return Yeah those yes I I did those Uh Jacob let me add here for the purpose of the records to be clear for the years in which Hawk Corporation did file its own returns Those have been produced All right And the other order also was that we be provided with a copy of all Hall corporation checks and statements in your possession showing payment for legal services rendered from 2002 to present day And I know that Ledger shows some payments of attorneys expenses but I don't recall seeing any statements that might have been redacted with respect to legal bills to Hall Corporation and Stephanie just for the record I want to make you aware that Mr Hall presented you with all the checks with all the bank statements with all the credit cards with all the Ledgers with all the documentation that he had in his possession So let's move on from this and and so we can go through whether or not the checks are there as we go through The ledgers in the ledgers indicate certain expenses such as they are And I believe also the order was the front and back of any checks transfers statements and documents in your possession from the financial account commonly referred to as Jacob two with the account number 675543662 To the extent that they were available you have everything and and so the record to be clear we will not reproduce the documents that had otherwise been identified in deposition transcripts or there was a substantial documentation produced by the CLM Credit Union which obviously we all got copies of and we did not reproduce those so that it is your testimony that we have everything that we are entitled to pursuant to the court order Again you have everything",
